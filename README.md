# Thesis projects
#### Master Thesis (in Computer Vision)
Title: Estimation of shape, illumination and reflectance from a single image<br/>
Lab: Computer Vision Group, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology<br/>
Time frame: Jun 2012 - Feb 2013<br/>
Tools & Technologies: C/C++, Matlab, MEX Framework<br/>
Summary: Developed a model to jointly estimate shape, light and color components from an image. Tested model on a standard benchmark dataset as well as objects in the real world. Obtained upto 60% higher accuracy than existing status quo methods.<br/>
Key words: shape from shading, backward forward model, limited bfgs
