# Thesis projects
#### Master Thesis (in Computer Vision)
Title: Estimation of shape, illumination and reflectance from a single image<br/>
Lab: Computer Vision Group, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology<br/>
Time frame: Jun 2012 - Feb 2013<br/>
Tools & Technologies: C/C++, Matlab, MEX Framework<br/>
Brief rundown: Developed a model to jointly estimate shape, light and color components from an image. Tested model on a standard benchmark dataset as well as objects in the real world. Obtained higher accuracy than existing status quo methods.

#### Semester Thesis (in Machine Learning) (2)
Title: Clustering neural systems using generative embedding<br/>
Lab: Machine Learning Laboratory, Dept. of Computer Science (ETH Zurich) & Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research (University of Zurich) <br/>
Time frame: Jun 2011 - Dec 2012<br/>
Tools & Technologies: Matlab<br/>
Brief rundown: Implemented unsupervised learning algorithms, perform a statistical analysis and visualized disorder groups found in fMRI data.

#### Semester Thesis (in Data Mining) (1)
Title: Social data mining on smartphones<br/>
Lab: Communication Systems Group, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology<br/>
Time frame: Feb 2011 - Jun 2011<br/>
Tools & Technologies: Android SDK, Java, SQLite, Excel<br/>
Brief rundown: Created and deployed an android application to log contact data. Integrated the app with a game running in the foreground. Conducted thorough measurements and tested for scalability.
